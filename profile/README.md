# Houses on The Air

Houses on The Air (HOTA) is an amateur radio activity that encourages operators to set up and operate from various houses. The goal is to promote fixed operations and to make contacts with other amateur radio operators from unique house locations. Participants can enjoy the challenge of setting up their equipment in different environments and can earn awards based on the number of unique house locations they activate and the number of contacts they make.
